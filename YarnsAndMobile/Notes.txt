To add a default administrator role and user
	See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50785009/how-to-seed-an-admin-user-in-ef-core-2-1-0
		Seed the admin role into the IdentityRole entity (in DbContext.OnModelCreating)
		Create seed code for the admin user (in ApplicationDbInitializer.SeedUsers)
		Call AddRoles<IdentityRole> when registering Identity
		Call ApplicationDbInitializer.SeedUsers(userManager) from Startup.Configure (requires injecting userManager)

To enable roles
	See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles?view=aspnetcore-5.0
	See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50426278/how-to-use-roles-in-asp-net-core-2-1
	Additionally, call AddRoleManager<RoleManager<IdentityRole>>() when registering Identity

To enable SQL debugging for EF queries
	Call EnableSensitiveDataLogging() when registering DbContext in Startup.ConfigureServices
	Add "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command":  "Information" to appsettings.json under Logging/LogLevel
	I recommend qualifying this by both a user defined configuration setting and development mode
